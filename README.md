Customer Cohort Analysis for E-Commerce
Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Customer Cohort Analysis on an e-commerce dataset. By leveraging machine learning clustering techniques, it segments customers into distinct behavioral groups. The insights derived are crucial for developing targeted strategies to:

Retain VIP customers

Nurture high-potential segments

Re-engage at-risk customers

The ultimate goal is to optimize marketing efforts and maximize Return on Investment (ROI).

Tech Stack & Tools
Python – The primary programming language used for the analysis.

Pandas – For sophisticated data manipulation, transformation, and cohort analysis.

NumPy – For efficient numerical computations and handling arrays.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) – For implementing the KMeans clustering algorithm to segment customers.

Yellowbrick – For visualizing clustering performance (e.g., Elbow Method, Silhouette Scores) and extracting model insights.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations to illustrate customer segments and trends.

Jupyter Notebook – The interactive development environment used for the entire analysis.

Key Insights & Business Impact
The analysis successfully segments the customer base into meaningful cohorts based on their purchasing behavior. These segments allow for data-driven decision-making:

VIP/Champion Segmentation: Identified most valuable customers for exclusive retention programs and loyalty rewards.

High-Potential Segmentation: Pinpointed customers with high lifetime value potential for targeted nurturing campaigns.

At-Risk Segmentation: Flagged customers showing signs of churn for proactive re-engagement strategies.

This targeted approach ensures efficient allocation of marketing resources and helps in driving higher customer lifetime value (CLV).
